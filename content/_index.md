My name is **Ning Zhang**, and I am currently a **"Bad"** Master's student at depatment of [Agricultural and Resource Economics](https://economics.arizona.edu) in [University of Arizona](https://arizona.edu) now. I am preparing for Ph.D. programs and seeking opportunities to work with excellent professors. At present, I am working as a Research Assistant with [Dr. George Frisvold](https://economics.arizona.edu/person/george-frisvold) in the field of Environmental Resource Economics. Unfortunately, I am still uncertain about which specific areas interest me the most; therefore, I am actively reading and exploring various economic topics to find those that truly captivate me.

我目前是一名亚利桑那大学农业与自然资源经济系的硕士研究生，流浪于美丽的图森。不要问我想做什么研究，因为我自己也不知道，我只想和[萨缪尔森](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BF%9D%E7%BD%97%C2%B7%E8%90%A8%E7%BC%AA%E5%B0%94%E6%A3%AE/4379952)谈谈。我目前在为经济学博士项目做准备，希望能学习到经济学的前沿理论。
