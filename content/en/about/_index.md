What is the Economics? 

I embarked on a long journey to uncover a deeper answer to this question. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a satisfying response and am still in the process of searching for  insights and training in economics.

At this period, I am not sure which kind people I am. I try to find myself and love myself. You can view my [CV](https://ning.im/cv/) and you may formally know more about me. 

I enjoy beer, cooking, travel, and cars. I often find myself lost in thought and am eager to engage in meaningful endeavors.

### What I Am Doing Now (Spring 2024)

### About Website

This website is built by [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) in R and based on Hugo and I used model and frame from [Yihui's](https://yihui.org) website. I love his thoughts about Internet and website building which would record your history and every step in modern Internet, but also people can preserve ideas from the past. 

I am not good at coding, obviously, this website has some bugs that I cannot fix it.
