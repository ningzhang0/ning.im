### **A Confused Person And Thoughtful Observer**

I have a lot of confusion about society, others and myself, and have been thinking about the reasons for it. Many of the things I see are irrational and I wish I could do better.

The main task in my free time is to constantly travel to various places to find, discover and record some unique social phenomena, which can make me think a lot. I regard myself as a boring person, and so do others think.
